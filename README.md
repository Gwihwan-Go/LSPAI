## 🛠️ Setup Guide

### 1. Configure Language Servers

1. Install Required Language Servers from VS Code Marketplace: if you pull the docker image, these are already downloaded.
   - Java: Oracle Java Extension Pack ( identifier : oracle.oracle-java)
   - Python: Pylance and Python extension ( identifier : ms-python.vscode-pylance, ms-python.python)
   - Go: Go extension ( identifier : golang.go)

2. Language-Specific Setup: if you pull the docker image, these are already setted.
   
   **For Go:**
   Enable semantic tokenization in your VS Code settings.json:
   ```json
   {
     "gopls": {
       "ui.semanticTokens": true
     }
   }
   ```

3. [Optional] Project Compilation
   - While not required, compiling your project can improve error diagnosis and auto-fixing capabilities
   - Refer Experiment Setup

### 2. Configure LLM Settings

LSPAI supports multiple LLM providers. Configure your preferred option in VS Code settings:

1. Open VS Code Settings (Ctrl/Cmd + ,)
2. Configure LLM settings using one of these methods:

   **Option A: Through VS Code Settings UI**
   - Search for "LSPAI" settings
   - Configure your preferred model and API keys

   **Option B: Direct JSON Configuration**
   Add the following to your VS Code User Settings (settings.json):
   ```json
   {
     "LSPAI": {
       "provider": "deepseek",
       "model": "deepseek-chat",  // Choose: // gpt-4o-mini"; // llama3-70b // deepseek-chat
       "openaiApiKey": "your-api-key",    // Required for OpenAI
       "deepseekApiKey": "your-api-key",  // Required for Deepseek
       "localLLMUrl": "http://your-ollama-server:port",  // Required for Ollama
       "proxyUrl": "your-proxy-server"    // Optional: Configure if using a proxy
     }
   }
   ```
   The settings may be shaded, but don't worry, it is normal effect.

### 3. Generate Unit Tests

Now you are ready!! 

To generate unit tests with LSPAI:

1. Open your workspace in VS Code
2. Navigate to the function/method you want to test
3. Right-click within the function definition
4. Select "LSPAI::Generate Unit Test" from the context menu
