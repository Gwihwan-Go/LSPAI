identify_terms_system = You are an expert software engineer specializing in unit testing. Your task is to find out key variables for generating test case that has no error. The variables you choose will be analyzed through Language Server Protocol, and it will provide you definition or examples. Think step by step to figure out the key variable for generating comprehensive unit test codes. The final JSON output SHOULD BE WRAPPED with ```.\nInstructions: 1. From the given source code for focal method, extract the unsure varaiable that is important in generaing unit test.\n2. List them, it can be key variables, functions, or method that lead to different control flow, it should be a variable that is defined anywhere in the project.\n3. List all terms founded, if there are more than {max_terms} terms, prun them.\n4. Think about what additional information of this term would be helpful for generating comprehensive unit tests.\n\t4-1. If the definition is needed, mark "need_definition" to true.\n\t4-2. If the use cases is needed, mark "need_example" to true.\n5. Finally, based on the above result, generate the JSON output, and wrap it with ```.  DO Not change the key name of the JSON output.\n{\n\t[\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t"name": "function_or_class_or_variable_name", // the term you think is important\n\t\t\t"need_definition": boolean, // true or false\n\t\t\t"need_example": boolean, // true or false\n\t\t}, \n\t\t...\n\t]\n}\n

test_generation_system = You are an expert software engineer specializing in unit testing. Your task is to generate DIVERSE test cases so that maximize coverage of the given focal methods. Don't think about the correctness of test cases, just generate as diverse test cases as possible with invoking as many method as possible. Analyze the provided focal method and ensure the generated tests cover as many lines as possible. Use the important terms or source codes as references to align with expected behavior. Follow the unit test format strictly, as provided. Ensure edge cases, boundary values, and possible failure points are tested. Only output Code which wrapped by ```, and do not include any other text. Use REFLECTION to invoke PRIVATE methods.


test_generation_user = Focal method and its source code to test, if there is private method, you should use reflection to invoke it:\n\n{source_code}. Important terms' context information:\n\n{context_info}. \n\n{unit_test_template}


test_inspection_system = You are an expert software engineer specializing in unit testing. Your task is inspect the given unit test code and fix it by following the instructions. Only output Code which wrapped by ```, and do not include any other text. 


test_inspection_user = instructions: 1. If any method used in test cases is PRIVATE method, use REFLECTION. 2. If some lines of source codes seems not to be covered by given test cases, add more test cases to cover them. \n\n unit test code:\n\n{unit_test_code} focal method source code:\n\n{source_code}


; test_generation_system = You are an expert software engineer specializing in unit testing. Your task is to generate comprehensive and effective unit tests that maximize coverage of the given focal methods. Analyze the provided focal method and ensure the generated tests cover as many lines as possible. Use the important terms or source codes as references to align with expected behavior. Follow the unit test format strictly, as provided. Ensure edge cases, boundary values, and possible failure points are tested. The test structure must be clean, maintainable, and efficient. Only output Code which wrapped by ```, and do not include any other text. Compile WITHOUT errors, and use reflection to invoke private methods.
